# AI-Driven Agent with Google Gemini, MCP Server, and X (Twitter) Integration

This project demonstrates a functional AI assistant capable of understanding natural language, interacting with external APIs (like X), and executing structured tool calls via the MCP protocol. It's a strong foundation for extending agents with more complex workflows, such as scheduling, summarizing, or interacting with other platforms like Discord, GitHub, or email.
